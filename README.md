# cedar-flask-demo

A very simple demo to show how you can use Cedar in Python, with a simple Flask based web application. This code is illustrative and verbose to help explain and show how Cedar works.

This repo contains the following demo sample app.

This demo would not be possible without the excellent work of **Stephen Kuenzli** and his [cedar-py library](https://github.com/k9securityio/cedar-py)

**Installation**

First make sure you have a version of Python greater than 3.9. When I built this I was using 3.10.11, but I have also used version 3.9.3 on my AWS Cloud9 environment. I followed [this guide](https://repost.aws/questions/QU14iutbqtSsm1gHwQwt02pA/upgrade-to-python-3-9-on-cloud-9) to help me deploy pyenv.

To get this up and running, first create a virtual Python environment

```
python -m venv cedar-demo
source cedar-demo/bin/activate
cd cedar-demo
```

Check out the code

```
git clone https://github.com/094459/cedar-flask-demo.git
```

Install dependencies

```
cd cedar-flask-demo/flask-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be able to start the application

```
python app.py
```

Opening a browser at http://localhost:8080 should bring up the Flask app. To login, check out the users.dat file for sample users.
