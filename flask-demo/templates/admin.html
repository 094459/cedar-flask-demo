<p>Cedar is a language for defining permissions as policies, which describe who should have access to what. It is also a specification for evaluating those policies. Use Cedar policies to control what each user of your application is permitted to do and what resources they may access.</p>
<p>This is a simple demo of how you can use Cedar with Python. It uses an open source project from k9 Security, called <a href="https://github.com/k9securityio/cedar-py">cedar-py</a></p>

    Find out more by checking out the <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en/learn">Learning resources</a> available for Cedar. Also make sure you check out the slack Cedar community. It is a great way to meet the community and find out more about how and why developers are using Cedar.
