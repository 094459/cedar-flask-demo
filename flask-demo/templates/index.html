<h5><strong>Cedar Flask Demo</strong></h5>
<p>This is a simple demo that showcases how you can integrate Cedar into your Python applications. This mimics a simple photo sharing application, which has a number of different access requirements. There is public access, user access, user admin access, and administrate access, all of which unlock certain parts of the site (for simplicity it is just the top level menus).</p>
<p>You can login using a number of sample users (check the users.dat file). These all have different levels of access. The level of access is defined by the user (or entity) and the cedar policy. You can view these files and update to experiment.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Cedar</strong></h5>
<p>Cedar is a language for defining permissions as policies, which describe who should have access to what. It is also a specification for evaluating those policies. Use Cedar policies to control what each user of your application is permitted to do and what resources they may access.</p>
<p>This is a simple demo of how you can use Cedar with Python. It uses an open source project from k9 Security, called <a href="https://github.com/k9securityio/cedar-py">cedar-py</a></p>
<p>Please check out some of the resources below to learn more about Cedar, including a hands on tutorial with interactive labs, and fun demo applications that help you see Cedar in action</p>
